# Surf's Up!
We have discovered a passion for surfing and want to move to Hawaii, with a plan to open up an ice cream and surf shop on the beach in Oahu. We have some savings but also need some investor backing. One investor (W. Avy) is very interested, but is hesitant because of a similar previous venture that failed in a rainy location.

## Overview
In this project, to address the concerns of our potential investor, we analyze weather data in the proposed location of our ice cream and surf shop business. Specifically, we exampine the key differences in temperatures between June and December, and provide two recommendations for further analysis.


## Results
From a temperature standpoint, there's not a major difference between June and December in Oahu.
