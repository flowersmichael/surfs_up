# Surf's Up!
We have discovered a passion for surfing and want to move to Hawaii, with a plan to open up an ice cream and surf shop on the beach in Oahu. We have some savings but also need some investor backing. One investor (W. Avy) is very interested, but is hesitant because of a similar previous venture that failed in a rainy location.

## Overview
In this project, to address the concerns of our potential investor, we analyze weather data in the proposed location of our ice cream and surf shop business. Specifically, we exampine the key differences in temperatures between June and December, and provide two recommendations for further analysis.


## Results
From a temperature standpoint, you can see that December is generally colder than June, but the differences aren't drastic. 


June Temperature Summary

December Temperature Summary

* The mean temperature in June is about 75 degrees, whereas in December the mean is 71 degrees. 
* The minimum temperature from our dataset in December is quite a bit lower than June, at 56 degrees versus 64 degrees in June. The max temperatures are close, with December getting up to 83 degrees and June only topping out at 85 degrees. 
* In terms of how ofetn you get cooler days in each month, we observe that about 75% of the time in December, the temperature is above 69 degrees. In June, about 75% of the time the temperature is above 73 degrees. 
* There is more variance in December temperatures versus June, with a standard of deviation of about 3.75 degrees versus June's 3.25 degrees.


## Summary
It's helpful to know that there's not a drastic difference between the June and December climates in Oahu. In general, the data from both months are pretty similar, in terms of what you can expect on your average day or during your average week in either month. Temperature wise, they should feel quite similar, with December a bit cooler as expected and also with a little more temperature variance from day to day.

From an investor's perspective, however, there are several other weather data points I'd be interested in seeing. 

For example, are there different climates in Oahu? On the big island of Hawaii, for example, there are 10 different climate zones. At any given moment it can feel very different on different parts of the big island. Oahu is a lot smaller and different, but we should confirm whether or not the climate data we're using fits the specific location we're looking to place our ice cream and surf shop.

Additionally, the temperature data is certainly helpful, but what about other weather elements such as wind and perhaps most importantly, precipitation? It would be very helpful to query and review both wind and precipation measurements near our proposed location. It'd be helpful to not only review this data for June and December to get a feel for the different seasons, but at least one month from the Spring and Fall seasons as well.
